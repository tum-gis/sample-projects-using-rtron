# Sample projects using r:tr책n as a library

[r:tr책n](https://rtron.io) is a road space model transformer library for OpenDRIVE, CityGML and beyond.

With r:tr책n you can write transformation recipes as run scripts, but also consume r:tr책n's components as a library.
This includes functionality for reading, transforming, analyzing, writing and so on.
 
The [sample-java-project](sample-java-project) and [sample-kotlin-project](sample-kotlin-project) project show a small example implementation of an OpenDRIVE dataset analysis.
