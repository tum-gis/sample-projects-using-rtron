# Sample projects using r:tr책n as a library

[r:tr책n](https://rtron.io) is a road space model transformer library for OpenDRIVE, CityGML and beyond.

You can use r:tr책n components as a library.
This includes functionality for reading, transforming, analyzing, writing and so on.

The sample [java-project](java-project) and sample [kotlin-project](kotlin-project) project show a small example implementation of an OpenDRIVE dataset analysis, with an output like this for example:

```bash
OpenDRIVE dataset at sample-projects-using-rtron\datasets\Town01.xodr
Number of roads: 98
Length of all roads: 3923.071893814179
Number of junctions: 12
Number of total geometry elements in plan view: 464

Each id in the element 'road' was used exactly once.
```
The Jitpack variants obtain r:tr책n from the on-demand package repository [jitpack.io](https://jitpack.io).
